The salary data was scraped on [Spotrac.com](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/rankings/earnings/2023/center/active/) and the career total points was retrieved from NBA.api.

I created a web scraper designated for retrieving data on this particular website.

Finally, the visulization was done by Tableau.
